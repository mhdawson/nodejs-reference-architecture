# GraphQL Development

Our teams have extensive knowledge in developing GraphQL solutions and recomending number of packages depending on your
use cases and languages.

## Building GraphQL API from scratch

When building GraphQL API from scratch we recomend using reference GraphQL-js reference implementation which was 
proven to be the most performant and have continous support from community. Entire development is currently backed by Linux foundation.

### GraphQL Server

For GraphQL Server we recomend using GraphQL-Express for exposing GraphQL APIs over the network 

https://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server

For building GraphQL schema we recomend using GraphQL-Tools:

Developers can use top level database query languages. 
We recomend using Knex(http://knexjs.org/) for performing queries from GraphQL to relational databases.

If your GraphQL model contains relationships please consider using DataLoader to prevent from overfetching problem:

DataLoader: https://github.com/graphql/dataloader

### GraphQL Client

For GraphQL client we recomend URQL (https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) that can work with React and any other JS based library. 
When using bundler we strongly recomend to compile your graphql queries using GraphQL-Tag:

https://github.com/apollographql/graphql-tag

## Typescript support

If you use typescript in your project we recomend GraphQL-Code-Generator to generate typings for both client and server:

## Out of the box GraphQL API with CRUD handling

Graphback (https://graphback.dev) can be used to minimize the amount of boilerplate when building GraphQL API.
Graphback is basing on https://graphqlcrud.org specification to deliver out of the box GraphQL API on top of 
popular databases like MongoDB and Postgress.

Graphback can:
- Provide you number of getting started templates
- Mock your backend based on schema (using GraphQL-Serve)
- Build GraphQL resolvers that will fetch data automatically from
- Generate client side queries and fragments for client side minimizing amount of boilerplate
- Providing production ready subscriptions for your model.
- Provide authentication, authorization for your GraphQL API
- Enable data synchronization (with https://offix.dev used on the client)
